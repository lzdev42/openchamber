# OpenChamber

A fork of [OpenChamber](https://github.com/btriapitsyn/openchamber) with an **AI Router** layer for robust, provider-agnostic AI workflows.

---

## What's Different

This fork adds an **AI Router** that solves two practical problems when chaining multiple AI providers:

1. **Unified `thinking` parameter** — Different providers expose "reasoning/thinking" mode via incompatible parameter names and formats. The AI Router normalizes these so you can switch providers without rewriting prompts or API calls.

2. **Automatic failover** — If an API endpoint goes down or returns an error, the AI Router automatically reroutes the request to a backup provider, preventing automated workflows from silently stopping mid-task.

The AI Router **only supports the OpenAI-compatible protocol**. Any provider that exposes an OpenAI-compatible endpoint can be configured directly in the AI Router — including Claude (via Anthropic's OpenAI-compatible endpoint or OpenRouter), DeepSeek, Kimi, Zhipu, Ollama, vLLM, and others. There is no plan to support the Claude native API, since the OpenAI-compatible protocol already covers those models and keeps the failover logic simple and robust.

Everything else stays identical to upstream OpenChamber.
